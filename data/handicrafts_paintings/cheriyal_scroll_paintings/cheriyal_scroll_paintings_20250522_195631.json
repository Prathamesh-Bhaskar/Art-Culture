    "title": "Cheriyal Scroll Painting",
    "summary": "Cheriyal scroll painting is a traditional stylized religious cloth-scroll art originating from Telangana, India. These narrative paintings, resembling film rolls or comic strips, depict stories from Indian mythology, Puranas, and Epics. Historically, they were prevalent across Andhra and other regions, used as 'Charanachitras' or 'Yamapatas' for didactic storytelling, educating the unlettered with visual aids and recitations. The earliest known reference dates back to the 2nd century BC in Mahabhashya. Once widespread, the art form has seen a significant decline with the advent of television, cinemas, and computers, and is now primarily made only in Hyderabad, specifically in Cheriyal town. It shares common origins with other textile scroll paintings like Patachitra and Phad.",
