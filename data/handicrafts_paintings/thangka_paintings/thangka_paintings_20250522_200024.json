    "title": "Thangka",
    "summary": "A thangka is a traditional Tibetan Buddhist painting, typically on cotton or silk appliqué, depicting Buddhist deities, scenes, or mandalas. These unframed scrolls are mounted on a textile backing with a silk cover, designed to be rolled up when not on display. Thangkas vary in size, from small pieces for personal meditation or monastic instruction to very large ones displayed during religious festivals. They serve as crucial teaching tools, illustrating the life of Buddha, influential lamas, and bodhisattvas, including concepts like the Wheel of Life. Their delicate nature requires dry storage to preserve the silk. Historically, Tibetan Buddhist painting evolved from earlier widespread Buddhist art traditions found in places like Ajanta and Mogao Caves. Today, printed reproductions are common for devotional and decorative use.",
