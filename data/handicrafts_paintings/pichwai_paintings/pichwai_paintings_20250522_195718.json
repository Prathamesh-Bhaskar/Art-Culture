    "title": "Pichhwai",
    "summary": "Pichhwai, meaning 'that which hangs from the back' in Sanskrit, are large devotional Hindu painted pictures, typically on cloth, primarily depicting Krishna. Originating in the Deccan, they are mainly associated with the Pushtimarg tradition and the Shrinathji Temple in Nathdwara, Rajasthan, where they hang behind the idol of Shrinathji. Their purpose is to portray Krishna's 'leelas' and narrate his tales to the illiterate. Temples use sets that are changed according to festivals and seasons. These paintings are part of the broader Nathdwara painting style, featuring iconography of Shrinathji, other Krishna forms like Dwarkadish, and figures like Vallabhacharya, serving as both ritualistic backdrops and artistic documentation of worship.",
