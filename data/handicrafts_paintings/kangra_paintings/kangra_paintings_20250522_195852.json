    "summary": "Kangra painting is a renowned pictorial art form originating from the Kangra State in Himachal Pradesh, India. It rose to prominence in the mid-18th century, eventually defining the broader Pahari painting school due to its significant volume and content. This exquisite art style was officially registered under the Geographical Indication of Goods Act on April 2, 2012. Historically patronized by Rajput rulers between the 17th and 19th centuries, its main centers included Guler, Basohli, and Kangra. Maharaja Sansar Chand was a pivotal patron, under whom it became the most important center of Pahari painting. Kangra art is now displayed in international museums, including those in Zurich, London, and Boston.",
