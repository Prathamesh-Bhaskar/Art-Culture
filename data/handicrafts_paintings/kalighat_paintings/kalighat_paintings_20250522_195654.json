    "title": "Kalighat painting",
    "summary": "Kalighat painting, also known as Kalighat Patachitra, is a distinctive Indian painting style originating in 19th-century Kolkata, West Bengal. Practiced by \"patuas\" near the Kalighat Kali Temple, these paintings feature bold outlines, vibrant colors, and minimal backgrounds. They depicted Hindu deities, mythological tales, and scenes from everyday life, serving as a visual record of 19th and early 20th-century socio-cultural transitions. The style reached its peak during this period. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London houses the world's largest collection, comprising 645 pieces. The exact origin date is debated among art historians, though material evidence suggests the first half of the 19th century, coinciding with the temple's establishment.",
