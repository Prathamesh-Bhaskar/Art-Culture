    "title": "Patachitra",
    "summary": "Patachitra or Pattachitra is a traditional, cloth-based scroll painting form predominantly found in the eastern Indian states of Odisha and West Bengal, with a parallel tradition in parts of Bangladesh. Known for its intricate details and depictions of mythological narratives and folktales, Pattachitra is an ancient art form. Historically, it served ritualistic purposes, functioned as souvenirs for pilgrims to temples like Puri, and was an integral visual component of ancient Bengali narrative performances. The term 'Pattachitra' combines the Sanskrit words 'patta' (cloth) and 'chitra' (picture), reflecting its core medium and purpose. The Odisha Pattachitra style, over a thousand years old, is deeply rooted in Hinduism, drawing inspiration particularly from Jagannath and Vaishnava traditions, utilizing natural colors applied by traditional Chitrakaras.",
