    "title": "Madhubani Art",
    "summary": "Madhubani art, also known as Mithila art, is a traditional painting style originating from the Mithila region across India (Bihar, West Bengal) and Southern Nepal. Historically practiced by women, it uses natural dyes and pigments like ochre and lampblack, characterized by striking geometrical patterns. The art serves ritualistic purposes for significant life events like births, marriages, and festivals such as Holi and Durga Puja. Tools include fingers, twigs, brushes, and matchsticks. Its origins are linked to King Janak's request for Sita's wedding. Though traditionally wall art, it's now also done on paper and canvas. Madhubani art is actively preserved by institutions and is a major export from its region.",
