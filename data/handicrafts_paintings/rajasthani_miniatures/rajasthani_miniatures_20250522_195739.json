    "title": "Rajput painting",
    "summary": "Rajput painting refers to the art produced in regional Hindu courts during the Mughal era, roughly from the late 16th to the mid-19th century. It is traditionally divided into Rajasthan and Pahari painting, flourishing in areas under Rajput chiefs. The nomenclature was introduced by Ananda Coomaraswamy in 1916. Evolving from 16th-century Hindu painting, it significantly absorbed Mughal influences, yet maintained a distinct identity, particularly in its predilection for universal rather than individual themes. Styles varied from conservative, preserving traditional values, to those showing greater Mughal impact. Local styles developed in the 17th century, gaining prominence in the 18th, but gradually ceased to exist in the 19th century due to political decline and the rising influence of Western art.",
