    "title": "Warli Painting",
    "summary": "Warli painting is a traditional tribal art form originating from the North Sahyadri Range in Maharashtra, India, primarily practiced by the Warli tribe. Thought to date back possibly to the 10th century C.E., it gained wider recognition from the 1970s, largely due to artist Jivya Soma Mashe. This folk style centers on Mother Nature, with farming as a core aspect of their culture, respecting wildlife and natural resources. Artists use basic geometric shapes—circles for the sun/moon, triangles for mountains/trees, and squares for human inventions or sacred enclosures—to depict scenes on their clay hut walls, often featuring a central \"chauk\" motif of the mother goddess Palghat. It remains a vibrant contemporary practice.",
