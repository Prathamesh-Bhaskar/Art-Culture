    "title": "Mughal painting",
    "summary": "Mughal painting is a distinct South Asian style of miniature painting on paper, originating in the Mughal Empire from the 16th to 18th centuries. Evolving from Persian miniature painting, it incorporated Chinese influences and developed a notable emphasis on realistic portraiture, as well as detailed depictions of animals and plants. Common subjects include royal life, hunting scenes, battles, mythology, and illustrations for literary works and imperial memoirs like the Padshahnama. Mughal emperors actively patronized and disseminated this art form, which later spread to various Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh courts across northern India, giving rise to regional 'post-Mughal' styles that were often bolder but less refined.",
