    "title": "Phad painting",
    "summary": "Phad painting is a traditional religious scroll and folk art form originating from Rajasthan, India, typically executed on long cloth or canvas called 'phad'. It vividly portrays narratives of folk deities, predominantly Pabuji and Devnarayan. Bhopas, the priest-singers, utilize these painted phads as mobile temples for the Rebari community. Traditionally crafted with vegetable colors and exclusive to the Joshi community, the art form underwent a significant revolution by Shree Lal Joshi and Pradip Mukherjee approximately four decades ago. Shree Lal Joshi further ensured its accessibility by establishing Joshi Kala Kendra (now Chitrashala) in 1960, making the art available for everyone to learn.",
