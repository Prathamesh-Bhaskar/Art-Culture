    "title": "Chitrakathi",
    "summary": "Chitrakathi is the name of an occupational caste and a traditional Indian art form centered around narrating stories with the aid of pictures. The term combines 'chitra' (picture) and 'katha' (story). Historically practiced by the Thakar tribal community, migrating storytellers in Maharashtra and parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, they use bundles of single-sheet paintings called 'pothi' to depict themes from epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata and mythical tales. Despite being almost extinct, this art form was notably conserved and honored by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.",
