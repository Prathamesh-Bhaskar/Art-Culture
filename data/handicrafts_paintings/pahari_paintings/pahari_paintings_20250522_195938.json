    "title": "Pahari painting",
    "summary": "Pahari painting is an umbrella term for miniature Indian paintings originating from the lower Himalayan hill kingdoms of North India, flourishing from the early 17th to mid-19th century. Regions like Basohli, Kangra, and Garhwal were prominent centers. Its central theme is the eternal love of Radha and Krishna, characterized by lyricism, spontaneous rhythm, softness, intricate details, and intense emotional portrayal. Developing from Mughal painting, it was patronized by Rajput kings and includes distinct styles such as the bold Basohli and delicate Kangra, the latter inspired by Jayadeva's Gita Govinda.",
