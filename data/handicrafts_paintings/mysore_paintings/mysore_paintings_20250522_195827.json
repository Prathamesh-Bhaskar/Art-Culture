    "title": "Mysore painting",
    "summary": "Mysore painting is a significant classical South Indian art form that originated in and around Mysore, Karnataka. Nurtured by the Mysore rulers, this distinct style evolved from the Vijayanagara Empire's painting traditions after its fall in 1565 AD. Artists migrated and adapted local customs, giving rise to styles like Mysore and Tanjore painting. Characterized by elegance, muted colors, and meticulous attention to detail, Mysore paintings predominantly feature themes of Hindu gods, goddesses, and scenes from Hindu mythology. Its historical roots trace back to the ancient Ajanta Caves period.",
