    "title": "Thanjavur Painting",
    "summary": "Thanjavur painting is a classical South Indian painting style originating from Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. Its roots trace back to approximately 1600 AD under the Nayakas, though the style as known today developed in the Maratha court (1676–1855). Characterized by rich, vivid colors, iconic compositions, extensive gesso work, glittering gold foils, and inlay of glass beads or gems, it reflects influences from Deccani, Vijayanagara, Maratha, and European styles. Primarily depicting Hindu gods, goddesses, and saints as devotional icons, it also features subjects from Puranas, Sthala-puranas, and occasionally other religious or secular themes. These panel paintings, known as 'palagai padam', are now popular souvenirs in South India and received Geographical Indication status in 2007–08.",
