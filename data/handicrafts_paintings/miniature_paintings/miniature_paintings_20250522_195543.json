    "title": "Mughal painting",
    "summary": "Mughal painting is a South Asian miniature painting style, originating in the Mughal Empire from the 16th to 18th centuries. It evolved from Persian miniature painting, incorporating elements of Chinese origin. Characterized by a strong interest in realistic portraiture and detailed depictions of animals and plants, it illustrated diverse subjects including battles, court life, hunting scenes, and royal memoirs like the Padshahnama. Mughal emperors were instrumental in its development and spread. The style later diffused to other Indian courts, leading to regional variations known as 'post-Mughal' or 'provincial Mughal' art, often depicting Hindu subjects.",
