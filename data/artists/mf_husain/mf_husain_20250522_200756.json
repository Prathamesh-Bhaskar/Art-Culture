    "summary": "Maqbool Fida Husain (1915â€“2011) was a prominent Indian painter and film director, known for his narrative paintings in a modified Cubist style. A founding member of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group, he significantly contributed to Indian modernism in the 1940s. His diverse themes included figures like Gandhi and Mother Teresa, as well as Indian epics and life. Husain's later works, featuring nude portrayals of Hindu deities, sparked considerable controversy, leading to lawsuits and his self-imposed exile from 2006 until his death. Despite controversies, his artistic legacy is immense, with a painting auctioned for a record $2.5 million in 2020. He also received a National Film Award and directed feature films.",
