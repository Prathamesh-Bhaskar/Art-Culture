    "title": "Manjit Bawa",
    "summary": "Manjit Bawa (1941-2008) was a prominent Indian painter known for his distinctive use of color and mythological themes. Born in Dhuri, Punjab, he studied fine arts in New Delhi, where professor Abani Sen profoundly influenced his focus on figurative art. He also worked and studied in Britain as a silkscreen printer. Upon returning to India, Bawa rejected European painting styles, drawing inspiration instead from Indian mythology, Sufi poetry, and Sikh scriptures. His canvases are characterized by vibrant, traditionally Indian colors like ochre, green, and red, distinguishing him from artists who used dominant grays and browns. He frequently depicted figures such as Ranjha, Lord Krishna, Kali, and Shiva, employing unique stylization and distortion.",
