    "summary": "Francisco Victor Newton de Souza (1924–2002), widely known as F. N. Souza, was a significant figure in modern Indian painting and a co-founder of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group. His distinct style blended decadence with primitivism. Born in Goa, he moved to Bombay and faced expulsions from art schools due to rebellious actions, including participation in the Quit India Movement. He later co-founded the influential Progressive Artists' Group in 1947. Following public complaints and struggles in India, he emigrated to London in 1949, where he initially faced difficulties but found success after his autobiographical essay 'Nirvana of a Maggot' was published. His 1955 exhibition at Gallery One sold out, establishing his career.",
