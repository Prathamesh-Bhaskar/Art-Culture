    "title": "Amrita Sher-Gil",
    "summary": "Amrita Sher-Gil (1913–1941) was a pioneering Hungarian-Indian painter, celebrated as \"one of the greatest avant-garde women artists of the early 20th century\" and a pivotal figure in modern Indian art. She began formal lessons at age eight, gaining early acclaim at 19 for her 1932 oil painting, *Young Girls*. Sher-Gil's art often depicted everyday life, integrating precolonial Indian art styles with contemporary culture, influenced by her extensive travels across Turkey, France, and India. Her significant legacy is often paralleled with the pioneers of the Bengal Renaissance. Though her work received limited recognition during her lifetime, her paintings are now among the most valuable by Indian women painters. Born Dalma-Amrita in Budapest, her background was a blend of Indian aristocracy and Hungarian-Jewish heritage, with her artistic talent noted early by her uncle, Ervin Baktay.",
