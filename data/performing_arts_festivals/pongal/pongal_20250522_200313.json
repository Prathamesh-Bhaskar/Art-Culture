    "summary": "Pongal is a multi-day Hindu harvest festival primarily celebrated by Tamils. The festival, which begins on the last day of the Tamil calendar month Margazhi, spans three or four days, including Bhogi, Thai Pongal, Mattu Pongal, and Kaanum Pongal. Thai Pongal, usually falling on January 14 or 15, is dedicated to the solar deity Surya and corresponds to Makar Sankranti. It marks the end of the winter solstice and the start of the Sun's northward journey. Named after the traditional dish 'Pongal' meaning 'boiling over,' the festival involves preparing this dish, decorating with kolam artworks, offering prayers, visiting temples, and exchanging gifts to renew social bonds. Mattu Pongal is specifically dedicated to the celebration of cattle. It is a major cultural event observed by the Tamil diaspora globally.",
