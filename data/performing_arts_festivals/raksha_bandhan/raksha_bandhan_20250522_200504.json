    "title": "Raksha Bandhan",
    "summary": "Raksha Bandhan is a popular and traditional Hindu annual rite or ceremony, central to a festival celebrated in South Asia and other regions influenced by Hindu culture. On this day, sisters tie a rakhi (talisman) around their brothers' wrists, symbolically protecting them, receiving a gift, and investing brothers with a share of responsibility for their care. Observed on the last day of the Hindu lunar month of Shravana (typically August), the expression means \"the bond of protection.\" Historically, the term also applied to a priest-patron ritual. The sister-brother festival, rooted in folk culture, is especially significant for married women due to the practice of village exogamy, often involving travel back to their natal homes.",
