    "summary": "Ganesh Chaturthi, also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi, is a significant Hindu festival celebrating the birthday of Lord Ganesh, the deity of new beginnings, wisdom, and obstacle removal. The festival involves the installation of Ganesh murtis in homes and public pandals, accompanied by Vedic hymns, prayers, fasting, and offerings like modak. It culminates on the tenth day with 'visarjana,' where murtis are immersed in water bodies. Observed globally by Hindus, especially in India and the diaspora, it falls between August 22nd and September 20th. Its public celebration was popularized by Lokamanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak in 1893 to foster Hindu nationalist identity during the anti-colonial movement.",
