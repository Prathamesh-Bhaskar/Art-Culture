    "title": "Kumbh Mela",
    "summary": "The Kumbh Mela is a significant Hindu pilgrimage celebrated approximately every 6 or 12 years, synchronized with Jupiter's revolutions. It is primarily marked by a ritual dip in sacred waters, believed to provide atonement for past mistakes and cleanse sins. Beyond its spiritual purpose, it is a vast community event featuring commerce, numerous fairs, religious discourses by saints, and mass gatherings of monks and pilgrims. Historically, before 1858, the name \"Kumbh\" was specifically applied to the mela in Haridwar, while Allahabad had a distinct annual Magh Mela. The festival has also been associated with historical violence, notably in 1796 in Haridwar, which required British intervention.",
