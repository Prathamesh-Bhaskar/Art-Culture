    "title": "Hemis Monastery",
    "summary": "Hemis Monastery is a significant Himalayan Buddhist monastery of the Drukpa Lineage, located in Hemis, Ladakh, India, on the bank of the Indus River. Re-established in 1672 by King Sengge Namgyal, it is renowned for its annual Hemis festival dedicated to Padmasambhava. The monastery gained controversial attention in the late 19th and early 20th centuries due to claims by Nicolas Notovitch and Swami Abhedananda of a manuscript, 'Life of Saint Issa', alleging Jesus's travels to India during his 'lost years'. These claims are widely regarded by historians as fabricated hoaxes.",
