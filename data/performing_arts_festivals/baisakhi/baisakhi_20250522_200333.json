    "title": "Vaisakhi",
    "summary": "Vaisakhi, also known as Baisakhi or Mesadi, is an annual spring harvest festival typically celebrated on April 13th or 14th, primarily in Punjab and Northern India. While culturally significant for Hindus as a harvest celebration and the Indian Solar New Year, for Sikhs, it critically marks the birth of the Khalsa order by Guru Gobind Singh on April 13, 1699. It also commemorates Ranjit Singh's proclamation as Maharaja in 1801 and is historically associated with the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919. Sikhs celebrate with kirtans, gurdwara visits, and processions, while Hindu communities observe it with ritual bathing and charity, known by various regional names.",
