    "title": "Gudhi Padwa",
    "summary": "Gudhi Padwa is a significant spring festival that marks the lunisolar new year for Marathi and Konkani Hindus. Celebrated primarily in Maharashtra, Goa, and Daman at the beginning of Chaitra, the first month of the lunisolar Hindu calendar, it is characterized by vibrant traditions. Festivities include creating colourful rangoli floor decorations, erecting a special 'gudhi dhvaja' adorned with cloth, flowers, mango/neem leaves, and a sugar crystal garland (gathi), topped with upturned vessels. Celebrations also feature street gatherings, dancing, and festive foods. While a new year for many, it is not universal for all Hindus, as some communities like those in Gujarat observe their new year during Diwali.",
