    "title": "Eid al-Fitr",
    "summary": "Eid al-Fitr, meaning 'Festival of Breaking the Fast', is one of the two major Islamic festivals, celebrated globally on the first day of Shawwal, the tenth month of the Islamic calendar. It marks the end of the month-long dawn-to-dusk fasting of Ramadan. The holiday involves a special two-rakat congregational prayer (salat) with varying numbers of additional Takbirs depending on the Islamic school (Hanafi, other Sunni, Shia). This prayer can be obligatory or strongly recommended. After the salat, Muslims celebrate with food as a central theme, earning it nicknames like 'Sweet Eid' or 'Sugar Feast'. The celebration was instituted by Prophet Muhammad in Medina.",
