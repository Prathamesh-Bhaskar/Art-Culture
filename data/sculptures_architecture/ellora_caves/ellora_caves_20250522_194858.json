Featuring Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain artwork dating from 600–1000 AD, they exemplify ancient Indian rock-cut architecture and religious harmony. Among its 100+ caves, 34 are open to the public, including the monumental Kailash temple (Cave 16), the largest monolithic rock excavation dedicated to Shiva.
