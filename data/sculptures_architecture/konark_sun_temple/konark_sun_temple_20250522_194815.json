    "summary": "The Konark Sun Temple is a 13th-century CE Hindu temple located in Odisha, India, attributed to King Narasingha Deva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty around 1250 CE. Dedicated to the Sun-god Surya, it exemplifies the pinnacle of Kalinga architecture, designed as a massive 100-foot high chariot. Though much of the original 200-foot structure is now in ruins, its intricate artwork, iconography, and erotic carvings are renowned. The cause of its destruction is debated, ranging from natural damage to deliberate sacking. Known as the \"Black Pagoda\" by European sailors, it served as a significant landmark. Partially restored by British India-era archaeological teams, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984 and remains a major Hindu pilgrimage site.",
