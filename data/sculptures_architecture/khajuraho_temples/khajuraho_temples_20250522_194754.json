    "title": "Khajuraho Group of Monuments",
    "summary": "The Khajuraho Group of Monuments, located in Chhatarpur district, Madhya Pradesh, India, is a collection of Hindu and Jain temples. Famous for their Nagara-style architectural symbolism and some erotic sculptures, most were constructed by the Chandela dynasty between 885 CE and 1000 CE. Originally numbering 85 temples, only about 25 survive today. The complex, including the intricately detailed Kandariya Mahadeva Temple, was overgrown by jungle until its rediscovery by Captain T.S. Burt in 1838. These monuments exemplify a tradition of religious acceptance and served an educational purpose. They were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1986 due to their outstanding architecture and testimony to the Chandela civilization.",
