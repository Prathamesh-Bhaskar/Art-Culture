    "summary": "The Ajanta Caves are 30 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments located in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, India, dating from the second century BCE to approximately 480 CE. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, these caves are considered masterpieces of Buddhist religious art, featuring some of the finest surviving examples of ancient Indian paintings and rock-cut sculptures that express emotions through gesture and form. Constructed in two main phases, they served as monasteries (Viharas) and worship-halls (Chaityas), depicting the past lives of the Buddha and tales from Aryasura's Jatakamala. After being covered by jungle, they were accidentally rediscovered in 1819 by British officer Captain John Smith.",
