This minaret and victory tower is part of the Qutb complex, situated at the site of Delhi's oldest fortified city, Lal Kot. Its construction was initiated by Qutab-ud-din Aibak around 1199 to mark the beginning of Islamic rule, with subsequent levels added by various Delhi Sultanate dynasties, notably completed by Firuz Shah Tughlaq in 1368. Comprising 399 steps, it is a highly frequented heritage site known for its elaborate Islamic architecture, including inscriptions and geometric patterns. In recent years, it has served as a symbol for international relations, illuminated for occasions like Mexico's and Turkey's national days.",
