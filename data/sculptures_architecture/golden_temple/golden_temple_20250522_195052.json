    "title": "The Golden Temple",
    "summary": "The Golden Temple, also known as Gurdwara Harmandir Sahib, is the pre-eminent spiritual site and a gurdwara located in Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is one of Sikhism's holiest places. Its sarovar was completed by Guru Ram Das in 1577, and Guru Arjan placed the Adi Granth there in 1604. The gurdwara was frequently destroyed by invading armies and rebuilt by Sikhs, most notably by Maharaja Ranjit Singh who rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, adding gold leaf in 1830. It served as a center for various movements and was damaged during Operation Blue Star in 1984, but was subsequently rebuilt. The Golden Temple is an open house of worship symbolizing Sikh beliefs in equality and universal welcome.",
