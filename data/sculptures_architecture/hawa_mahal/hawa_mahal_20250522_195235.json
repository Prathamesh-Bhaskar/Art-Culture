    "title": "Hawa Mahal",
    "summary": "The Hawa Mahal, also known as the “Palace of Winds,” is a unique five-story palace located in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh and designed by Lal Chand Ustad, it is constructed from red and pink sandstone. Its distinct honeycomb-like exterior features 953 intricately latticed small windows (Jharokhas). The palace's original intent was to allow royal ladies to observe street life and festivals without being seen, while also facilitating cool air circulation through the Venturi effect during hot summers. A significant renovation occurred in 2006, and it is currently a popular tourist spot, maintained by entities like the Unit Trust of India.",
