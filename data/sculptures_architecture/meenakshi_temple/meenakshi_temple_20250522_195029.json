    "summary": "Arulmigu Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, also known as Arulmigu Meenakshi Amman Thirukkovil, is a historic Hindu temple located in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. It is dedicated to Goddess Meenakshi (a form of Parvati), her consort Sundareśvarar (a form of Shiva), and her brother Aḻagar (a form of Vishnu). The temple is theologically significant for its confluence of Shaivism, Shaktism, and Vaishnavism. It is central to the ancient city of Madurai, mentioned in Tamil Sangam literature and 6th-century CE texts, and is one of the Paadal Petra Sthalams. Its west tower serves as the model for the Tamil Nadu State Emblem. Key constructions were undertaken by Pandyan Emperor Sadayavarman Kulasekaran I (1190-1205 CE) and subsequent Pandyan rulers like Maravarman Sundara Pandyan I and II.",
