    "title": "Fatehpur Sikri",
    "summary": "Fatehpur Sikri, located in Agra District, Uttar Pradesh, India, was founded as the capital of the Mughal Empire by Emperor Akbar in 1571. It served as the capital from 1571 to 1585, eventually being completely abandoned in 1610. The city's construction was partly motivated by the birth of Akbar's son, Jahangir, which was predicted by Sheikh Salim Chishti. Named the \"City of Victory\" after Akbar's successful Gujarat campaign in 1573, archaeological evidence indicates prior settlements existed here. After Mughal abandonment, the East India Company used it as an administrative center from 1803 to 1850. Recognizing its profound historical and architectural significance, Fatehpur Sikri was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986, preserving its legacy as a pivotal Mughal imperial city.",
